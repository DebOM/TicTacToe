# TicTacToe

Whether you're looking to demonstrate your mastery of [OOP, MVC](http://mamallamacoding.blogspot.com/2014/03/making-tictactoe-with-object-oriented.html), or even [AI](https://mostafa-samir.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/), this game has it all!

If you've built it before, take an hour to try another approach. One-player, Two-player, console, etc.
