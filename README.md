# TicTacToe

Whether you're looking to demonstrate your mastery of [OOP, MVC](http://mamallamacoding.blogspot.com/2014/03/making-tictactoe-with-object-oriented.html), or even [AI](https://mostafa-samir.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI/), this game has it all!

If you've built it before, take an hour to try another approach. One-player, [use a framework](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html), [play it on the commandline](http://adamboro.com/blog/misc/tic-tac-toe-in-terminal/), [realtime multiplayer](https://github.com/jefflembeck/socket-tic-tac-toe)([link 2](http://technomason.com/words/?p=315), [link 3](https://blog.dylants.com/2013/05/26/socket-io/)), [redux](http://ramonvictor.github.io/tic-tac-toe-js/), [etc](https://tic-tac-tic-tac-toe.firebaseapp.com/). 

Or, if you're not sure where to start, you're not alone, read how other folks worked through this project [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/41nw6v/i_find_tic_tac_toe_project_to_be_very_hard_help/).
